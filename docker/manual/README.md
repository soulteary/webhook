# Manual Docker Builds

This directory contains Dockerfiles for **manual or local** builds, as opposed to the release images produced by GoReleaser from `docker/goreleaser/`.

- **Dockerfile** – standard manual build
- **Dockerfile.alpine** – Alpine-based manual build

Use these when you want to build and run the image locally without going through the GoReleaser pipeline.
